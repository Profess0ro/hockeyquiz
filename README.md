# Hockeyquiz

### A quiz with questions of the fantastic game och hockey!
I want this game to be fun and not be questions about the game and the rules of the game. This will be a game about unique happenings that occur on or off the rink during a hockeygame. So even the people that have a lot of knowledge of the game of hockey will have a challenge.
